# The goal is to generate data with a wide range of parameters, to verify that the training 
# of a neural network is still possible despite the diversity of the data.

# We create a temporary version of the dataset, verifying that a neural
# network can still be trained on it despite the smaller number of genes
# and higher transfer rate
# We first try this dataset with a small sampling rate and a higher transfer rate
